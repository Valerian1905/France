        <h2>Major Sectors within France's Hospitality Industry</h2>
        <h3>Accommodation</h3>
        <p>I will also be telling about the major sectors within the hospitality industry in Farnce. Accommodation in France First sector is Accommodation that refers to budget hotels, hostels and chateaux this contributes majorly to the revenue. France also has luxury hotels such as Le Boutique Hotel & Spa is a boutique. Le Boutique Hotel & Spa is a boutique is a five star hotel that offers history of the country, heritage, comfort and luxury all under one roof.  One will appreciate and be mesmerised by the high ceilings and tall windows of the magnificent rooms. Each room has a unique design, but one will also find wooden parquet flooring in the bedroom area and Pyrenean slate in the bathrooms. Each room has unique decor that’s complemented by unique artwork, all of which have been personally selected by the owners. And those owners aren’t some large corporations, but a father and daughter team named Christophe and Anais who simply fell in love with the property and then converted it into their dream boutique hotel</p>

        <h3>Food in France</h3>
        <p>France is well known for its cuisine and French food such as baguettes, croissants and cheese. when I went to France, is that food is an experience to savour, not something you do quickly. Each region in France is well known for its own distinct culinary traditions and specialities that are widely influenced by its geography and history. The gastronomy is world-renowned, with restaurants, cafes, and patisseries playing a crucial role in both urban and rural settings. Michelin-star restaurants highlight the prestige, while small eateries and cafes showcase regional delicacies. In 2010, UNESCO created Intangible Cultural Heritage , a list that recognises knowledge, cultural practices and traditions instead of physical sites. The gastronomic meal of French was added to this list the name of the list is ‘Le repass gastronomique des Français ‘. This recognition was because the French cuisine is considered as a social custom that celebrates togetherness, pressurises on pleasure of taste and maintains the balance between humans and the products of the nature.  The ritual of eating in France includes things like setting the table, selection of dishes and matching the wine with food and the special emphasis on sharing and enjoying meals together. Oysters are a very popular food in France, especially during the Christmas season. This popularity comes from King Henri IV, reigning from 1553 to 1610, reportedly consumed up to 300 oysters in a single sitting. And Louis XIV had them delivered daily to Versailles. The famous American Chef and author by the name Julia Child taught the American housewife how to cook French food. I was very lucky to eat at the very restaurant, La Couronne, where Julia ate and they still serve the same menu thus preserving history.</p>
