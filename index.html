        <h2>Major Sectors within France's Hospitality Industry</h2>
        <h3>Accommodation</h3>
        <p>I will also be telling about the major sectors within the hospitality industry in Farnce. Accommodation in France First sector is Accommodation that refers to budget hotels, hostels and chateaux this contributes majorly to the revenue. France also has luxury hotels such as Le Boutique Hotel & Spa is a boutique. Le Boutique Hotel & Spa is a boutique is a five star hotel that offers history of the country, heritage, comfort and luxury all under one roof.  One will appreciate and be mesmerised by the high ceilings and tall windows of the magnificent rooms. Each room has a unique design, but one will also find wooden parquet flooring in the bedroom area and Pyrenean slate in the bathrooms. Each room has unique decor that’s complemented by unique artwork, all of which have been personally selected by the owners. And those owners aren’t some large corporations, but a father and daughter team named Christophe and Anais who simply fell in love with the property and then converted it into their dream boutique hotel</p>

        <h3>Food in France</h3>
        <p>France is well known for its cuisine and French food such as baguettes, croissants and cheese. when I went to France, is that food is an experience to savour, not something you do quickly. Each region in France is well known for its own distinct culinary traditions and specialities that are widely influenced by its geography and history. The gastronomy is world-renowned, with restaurants, cafes, and patisseries playing a crucial role in both urban and rural settings. Michelin-star restaurants highlight the prestige, while small eateries and cafes showcase regional delicacies. In 2010, UNESCO created Intangible Cultural Heritage , a list that recognises knowledge, cultural practices and traditions instead of physical sites. The gastronomic meal of French was added to this list the name of the list is ‘Le repass gastronomique des Français ‘. This recognition was because the French cuisine is considered as a social custom that celebrates togetherness, pressurises on pleasure of taste and maintains the balance between humans and the products of the nature.  The ritual of eating in France includes things like setting the table, selection of dishes and matching the wine with food and the special emphasis on sharing and enjoying meals together. Oysters are a very popular food in France, especially during the Christmas season. This popularity comes from King Henri IV, reigning from 1553 to 1610, reportedly consumed up to 300 oysters in a single sitting. And Louis XIV had them delivered daily to Versailles. The famous American Chef and author by the name Julia Child taught the American housewife how to cook French food. I was very lucky to eat at the very restaurant, La Couronne, where Julia ate and they still serve the same menu thus preserving history.</p>

        <p>The next sector of hospitality industry is tourism and travel services, this sector contributes from guided tours, historical sites and museums make up the key part of income. the tourism sector is well complimented by robust transportation network connecting various regions. Another sector that contributes to hospitality is events and conferences such as Olympics in the year 2024, Cannes film festival, and tour de France. all this attracts visitors and thus boost the occupancy rates and support local economies.

        <p>The Olympics in 2024 has also contributed to the France economy in a similar way by increasing the attract tourists from both domestic and overseas markets thus contributing to the economy. The French Centre for sports law and economics studied that this years Olympics. Olympics is the world leading sporting event. It features both summer and winter sports competition and accommodate athletes from all over the world. These games are considering world famous sports with more than 200 teams. they take place every four years and France hoisted the Olympics in 2024.The creation of this sport was inspired by ancient Olympics games that were held in Olympia in Greece  in the 8th century. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896.  The 2024 Summer Olympics provided an important opportunity for the host nation, France, as the events attract tourists from both domestic and overseas markets. generate at up to €10.7 billion and up to 247,000 jobs. Of the €10.7 billion, approximately €1.4-€3.5 billion (13-33%) is contributed to tourism-related economic impact. Research shows that the Olympics that were help in France this year has widely contributed to the countries economy due to the large entry or visit of visitors and increased spending of these visitors in hospitality sectors such as hotels, restaurants, on food, and museums. According to the Tourism Minister of France, Olivia Grégoire a comparison study showed that the spendings on hotels in the cities where the event was hosted was sixteen percent higher than previous years. while tourism-related sales at museums and restaurants saw a 25% increase year-on-year, Gregoire told French paper La Tribune Dimanche. The Banque de France anticipates economic growth between 0.35% and 0.45% for the third quarter of the event, compared to a 0.3% increase in the first two quarters of the event. This study shows  that up to 0.25% of the growth could be given to the Olympics, with the economic benefits largely because of the ticket sales and TV rights. </p>

        <h2>Impact of Hospitality on France's Economy</h2>
        <p>I have done a study on Hospitality industry in France on how it creates jobs in hotel industry , culinary arts, tour guiding, and more. Seasonal peaks, particularly in the summer and during festivals, significantly boost employment. This can be linked to the Festivals like Cannes and Olympics 2024. UESCO has recognised French Gastronomy as part of the "intangible cultural heritage," it also has luxury and boutique hotels which have been admired for its beauty. It is known for its wonderful customer service experience; the hospitality achieves this by blending with cultural warmth. A literature piece produced by studies done in the last two decades has shown the development of the geography of tourism in France done in in the couple of decades. According to this research it was strongly influenced by the geographic thoughts of France. </p>

        <h2>Geographical landscapes that attract tourists in France </h2>
        <p>France is well known for many of the natural beautiful attractions as well such as Camargue salt flats that are snow white and shockingly pink algae rich that attract poets and is a perfect setting for equestrians, wildlife spotters and exceptionally romantic souls. One can also see hundreds of flamingos in Parc Ornithologique du Pont de Gau. France and the lavender summer breeze are a perfect relaxation for nature and flower lovers. The purple hill of the Provence are legendary. Every summer, roughly from late June to early August, flowering lavender sets the hills of southern France alight with colour and perfume. One of the most iconic views is at the Abbaye Notre-Dame du Sasanqua, it is called the sea of lavender. Mid-July is the best time to visit for blooms. As the dusk falls one can see why the arches of Étretat excited many an impressionist artist. The chalk cliffs and rock arches that are formed by the erosion by wind and wate rover the millennia are one of the most beautiful and attractive coastal landscapes in France. Ther were many authors from the nineteen century that were inspired by the Étretat, to name few are French author Guy de Maupassant to painters such as Camille Corot, Eugène Boudin, Gustave Courbet and Claude Monet. If one looks closely, it resembled an elephant dipping its trunk into the sea as said by Maupassant. Another geographic landscape in France that attracts tourists is Aiguilles de Bavella in Corsica. This place is famous and is well know for its hike. Corsica feels like a different world from the mainland specially in summer. During the summer it looks like a flame with wildflowers it is located in  Aiguilles de Bavella, soaring over 1600m (5249ft). it has a very captivating view because of the great spires and turrets of granite.</p>

        <h2>Challenges Facing the Hospitality Industry</h2>
        <p>The hospitality industry does face few challenges like high labour cost, taxes and fluctuations in the number of tourists, this factor can affect profitability, especially for small business. Another challenge that the hospitality industry faced was during the covid 19 era when the travelling was at stand still and therefore there was no migrants and therefore no business. Environment sustainability plays a major role in cost effect in hospitality industry for the business who have been trying to reduce plastic waste and have been investing in recycling, but this affects the overall cost of the operation. There's a rise in eco-friendly hotels and responsible tourism. The next factor is Technological adaptation, the industry must adapt to the digital transformation such as online booking system and AI in guest services. The industry is now having personalized and digital experiences by starting Virtual reality, AI-driven booking assistance, and personalized travel experiences are becoming essential components, especially for luxury brands.</p>
